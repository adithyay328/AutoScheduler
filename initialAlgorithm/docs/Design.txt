Overall design of the algorithm:
Grab all time allocations for a particular user(off of postgresql)

Start by inputting all fixed time allocations, ensuring that there aren't any overlaps
Then, in all the empty spaces in between those, schedule in the flexible time allocations
    Take into account the maximum time per session, and the max time spent per day

Allow break configuration
    Ask people the minimum amount of time to spend on a task(i.e, no value schduling in 2 minutes to do a task, unless the task literally
    only lasts 2 minutes)
    Also add support for break frequency config, I.E. how frequently you want to take breaks
